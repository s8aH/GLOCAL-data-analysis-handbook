Data Visualization Tips
-----------------------

- **Always label axes and include units.**  
  Unlabeled axes or missing units make plots hard to interpret.

- **Define variables, units, and terms.**  
  Without clear definitions, numbers become ambiguous and potentially misleading. For example, a number like “46.0” means little without context—does it represent people, thousands, or percentage points? Use well-placed labels, concise legends, and brief axis notes to provide essential context.

- **Use clear and descriptive titles and captions.**  
  Indicate whether values represent a sum, mean, median, etc. in the title or caption to help prevent misinterpretation.

- **Display dates or time frames on the x-axis in ascending order** (unless there’s a specific reason not to). This makes it easier for everyone to interpret trends over time.

- **Choose appropriate plot types for your data.**  
  For example, use line charts for trends over time, bar charts for category comparisons, and boxplots for distributions.

- **Use consistent colors and legends** to help users distinguish categories, especially if you have multiple plots in a report.

- **Annotate key points or trends** directly on the plot if it helps highlight important findings.

- **Don’t overload a single plot with too much information.**  
  Split into multiple, simpler plots if necessary.

- **Include a legend if the plot contains multiple groups or categories.**

- **Check for misleading scales.**  
  For example, don’t cut off the y-axis to exaggerate differences unless you explain why.

- **Explain missing data.**  
  If some data points are missing or excluded, mention it in the caption or legend.
