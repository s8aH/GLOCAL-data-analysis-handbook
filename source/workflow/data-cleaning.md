# 2: Data Cleaning


Rename columns for clarity and drop any columns that won’t be useful for analysis.

Format/convert data: e.g., ensure numbers are integers/floats and dates are in a consistent format.

Handle missing data: fill in, impute, or drop missing values if they’re below a chosen threshold (e.g., less than 3% missing).

Check for duplicated rows or inconsistent formats and fix them as needed.
