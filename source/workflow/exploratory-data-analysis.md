# 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Show summary statistics for your data (e.g., mean, min, median, max, percentiles, etc.) to understand the overall distribution.

Plot distributions for each column and list the unique categories in categorical columns.

This helps you spot missing or unusual data early, so you can quickly decide if you need to switch datasets or merge with other datasets to fill in missing information.
