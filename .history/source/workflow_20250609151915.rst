Data Analysis Workflow
======================

Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---------------------------------------
- Show summary statistics for your data (e.g., mean, min, median, max, percentiles, etc.) to understand the overall distribution.
- Plot distributions for each column and list the unique categories in categorical columns.
- This helps you spot missing or unusual data early, so you can quickly decide if you need to switch datasets or merge with other datasets to fill in missing information.
- Show summary statistics (mean, min, max, percentiles, etc.).
- Plot distributions for each column and list categories within categorical columns.
- Identify missing or unusual data early; decide if merging with other datasets is needed.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
---------------------
- Rename columns for clarity and drop any columns that won’t be useful for analysis.
- Format/convert data: e.g., ensure numbers are integers/floats and dates are in a consistent format.
- Handle missing data: fill in, impute, or drop (if below a chosen threshold, e.g., <3% missing).
- Check for duplicates or inconsistent formats and resolve them.

Step 3: Feature Engineering
---------------------------
- Sometimes a single column contains too much information packed together—for example, "$50, North Glengarry, Township, Ontario." You can split this into separate fields (price, city, municipality, province) for better analysis and visualization.

Step 4: Data Visualization
--------------------------
- Use different plot types to highlight trends and patterns; choose the most interpretable format for your audience.
- Combine plots (e.g., line and bar) or display side-by-side for comparisons.
- Consider stacked bar charts for multiple trends in one plot.

Step 5: Data Analysis
---------------------
- Summarize key findings from your visuals and tables.
- Clearly highlight insights that could guide decisions or further analysis.
