Troubleshooting: When You Can’t Find Data
=========================================

This is a very common issue in the world of opendata, many sets are published as reports, and the methods in which they are obtained vary by province. You will not always find one set that can be used to describe X trends for all of Canada, you may even find that certain provinces have no data at all.

This is one of GLOCAL’s most important missions - addressing the fact that it is difficult to obtain this information, especially for the average Canadian.

First, check, double check, triple check that you are consulting the correct sources in your study - if you can find all of the data by modifying your research question, then that is likely your best option. Narrowing or adjusting the scope of your research can make the project feasible without compromising its value. If no data exists, document that gap. Absence of information is itself a finding - and noting it strengthens transparency and highlights areas for future inquiry or advocacy.
