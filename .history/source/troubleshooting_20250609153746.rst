Troubleshooting: When You Can’t Find Data
=========================================

- It’s common not to find data for some variables (e.g., some provinces may have gaps).
- Ensure you’re searching the right sources; reconsider your research question if needed.
- Narrow or adjust scope to make the project feasible.
- If no data exists, document the gap—absence of information is itself a finding and highlights needs for future research or advocacy.
