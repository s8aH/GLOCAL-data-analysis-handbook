Key Principles and Best Practices
=================================

- **Date & Time:** Always display dates or time frames on the x-axis in ascending order (unless there’s a specific reason not to). This makes trends easier to interpret.
- **Summary Statistics:** Clearly indicate in titles or captions whether values represent a sum, mean, median, etc., to prevent misinterpretation.
- **Define Variables & Units:** Always define variables, units, and terms—numbers need context to be meaningful. Use clear labels, concise legends, and brief axis notes for clarity.
