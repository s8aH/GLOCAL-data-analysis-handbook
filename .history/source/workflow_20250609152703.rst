Data Analysis Workflow
======================

Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---------------------------------------
- Show summary statistics for your data (e.g., mean, min, median, max, percentiles, etc.) to understand the overall distribution.
- Plot distributions for each column and list the unique categories in categorical columns.
- This helps you spot missing or unusual data early, so you can quickly decide if you need to switch datasets or merge with other datasets to fill in missing information.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
---------------------
- Rename columns for clarity and drop any columns that won’t be useful for analysis.
- Format/convert data: e.g., ensure numbers are integers/floats and dates are in a consistent format.
- Handle missing data: fill in, impute, or drop missing values if they’re below a chosen threshold (e.g., less than 3% missing).
- Check for duplicated rows or inconsistent formats and fix them as needed.

Step 3: Feature Engineering
---------------------------
- Sometimes a single column contains too much information packed together—for example, a value like "$50, North Glengarry, Township, Ontario." You can split this into separate columns (e.g., price, city, municipality, province), which makes it much easier to analyze and visualize specific patterns in the data
Step 4: Data Visualization
--------------------------
- Use different plot types to highlight trends and patterns; choose the most interpretable format for your audience.
- Combine plots (e.g., line and bar) or display side-by-side for comparisons.
- Consider stacked bar charts for multiple trends in one plot.

Step 5: Data Analysis
---------------------
- Summarize key findings from your visuals and tables.
- Clearly highlight insights that could guide decisions or further analysis.
