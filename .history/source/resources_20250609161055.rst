FOI Requests:  
Most public bodies in Canada are subject to freedom of information legislation - these are laws that give people access to public records that have not otherwise been released. In order to request an FOI, you should first talk to your supervisor to determine whether or not an FOI request is your best option - receiving a response could take weeks or months even, but it is often necessary.
