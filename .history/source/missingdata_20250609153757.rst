Handling Missing Data
=====================

- Investigate the reason for missing data: Is it private, confidential, or simply unreported?
- Avoid filling missing values with zeros, as this can be misleading.
- If data is unavailable despite efforts, note the reason in a comment below the plot.

Recommendations:
----------------
- Email the relevant government data officer for clarification.
- Search for alternative datasets, even if not from the same source, as long as key details align.

If possible, show distributions for different Indigenous groups. Use feature engineering or alternative data sources if needed.
